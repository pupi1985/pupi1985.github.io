There are many reasons to create content programatically. One of them could be having a new site with a small amount of users. In this case, site owners need to ask and answer their own questions in order to generate content. This process can be bothersome and slow using a web interface.

This is a very common situation most communities face when they are starting from scratch. Bulk Content Generator is a plugin that eases the process of creating content on sites. In short, it allows users to import a spreadsheet that contains questions, answers or comments and turn them into real posts in the site. It is also possible to configure the creation date of the posts (so that they don't look like they were created all in the same day) as well as the user who created them, among many other things.

Plugin features include:

 * Create questions, answers and comments taken from a file
 * All posts can be set an author or be anonymous
 * Questions can be set a category, tags and the Q2A extra value, if configured in the site
 * Answers can be selected
 * Ability to disable notifications on the created posts (to avoid any future email)
 * Ability to disable notifications while creating the posts (to avoid emails only while creating the posts)
 * All posts can be set a particular creation date in the past or it can even be generated randomly
 * Work is split into batches and progress is updated after processing each batch
 * Administrators can select what user levels can perform imports
