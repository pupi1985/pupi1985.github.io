Reactions are well-known features of many social networks. They are just a way to express a feeling generated by a post. Note this is a complementary behavior to voting on a post.

This is a screenshot of how they look:

The process of reacting to a post is as simple as clicking on a reaction. Users can change their minds and select a different reaction or just remove it.

Reactions can also be displayed in a more compact form:

The admin is able to very easily add new type of reactions, change them or delete them, so they can adapt to each site's needs. There are a few more settings the admin is able to change such as in which type of posts reactions should be displayed.

Plugin features include:

 * Posts (questions, answers and comments) can receive a reaction from a logged in user

 * Option to allow or not users to react to own posts
