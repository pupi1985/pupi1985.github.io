This plugin randomly selects an avatar from a directory that contains avatar images and assigns it to new users during registration. This way users start with some setup already in place. New avatar images can be added to the directory.

To make it short, just go the GitHub project and download it directly from there. There are also some notes in there that might be handy.

Features:

 * Images are randomly selected from a directory
 * Custom images can be added to the directory
 * No need of core hacks or plugin overrides
 * Simple installation
