I'm a [Q2A](http://www.question2answer.org) developer. You can find me in the Q2A Q&A site under the [**pupi1985**](http://www.question2answer.org/qa/user/pupi1985) username. 

## My contributions to the Q2A core

You can check my pull requests to the Q2A core in this [link](https://github.com/q2a/question2answer/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Apupi1985). If you want to thank me for the time I spent in this free project developing core features, performance improvements and bugfixes that users of your forum are enjoying while you're reading this, then you can send me a donation using [PayPal](https://paypal.me/pupi1985).

## My plugins

Every year I develop a couple of plugins. I try to bring to Q2A ideas that are either innovative or proven to work in other platforms. Check them out [here](/plugins/).

Premium plugins can be tested from [this link](http://q2a-pupi1985.herokuapp.com).
